I'm sharing three projects.
1. An SQL project creating and populating a database about metal music
2. Another SQL project including my code solutions for the final SQL test in the Data Analyst Expert course
3. An investigation and visualization project about Barcelona, in Python. Note: The interactive Folium maps may not display correctly in HTML format.
